## **Key Differences from MongoDB**
| **Feature**        | **MongoDB**   | **AWS DocumentDB**  |
|--------------------|----------------|----------------------|
| **Data Format**    | BSON (Binary) | JSON (Text-based)   |
| **Management**     | Self-managed  | Fully managed by AWS|
| **Compatibility**  | Native         | MongoDB-compatible  |

### **Benefits of DocumentDB**
- **Direct MongoDB Compatibility**: Works with existing MongoDB queries with minimal changes.
- **Managed Service**: Reduces operational complexity by handling scaling, backups, and updates automatically.
- **JSON-Based Communication**: Ensures smooth integration with most back-end services.
